# BrainTumor
The Brain Tumor Detection project leverages advanced image processing techniques to identify tumors in MRI images. This comprehensive system includes a secure login page developed using PHP and HTML, ensuring that only authorized users can access the platform. Once logged in, users are directed to a home page where they can upload MRI images and input relevant patient data. The data and images are then processed, and the results are displayed on a result page alongside the MRI images for easy interpretation. The project also incorporates a robust database created using phpMyAdmin to store patient information and diagnostic results securely. By integrating these components, the project provides an efficient and reliable tool for medical professionals to detect brain tumors and manage patient data seamlessly.
